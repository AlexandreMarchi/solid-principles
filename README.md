# solid-principles
SOLID principles are a set of design principles for writing maintainable and scalable code. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are fundamental to software development best practices. "SOLID" is an acronym formed from the first letters of five specific principles.

These principles promote cohesion, flexibility, and code reusability, making the software easier to understand, maintain, and extend over time.
